 When evaluating a particular blockchain platform, be sure to ask 
 whether it fulfills the six requirements of safe peer-to-peer database sharing:
 prevention of downtime and inconsistency, 
 as well as transaction forgery, 
 censorship, 
 reversal and 
 illegitimacy. 
 And beware of explanations that consist of too much mumbling or hand waving – they probably mean that the answer is no.
 
 
    Forgery: Transferring shares from one person to another without the sender’s permission.
    Censorship: Refusing to fulfill someone’s request to transfer some shares elsewhere.
    Reversal: Undoing a transfer that took place at some point in the past.
    Illegitimacy: Changing the total quantity of shares in the system without a corresponding action by the issuer.
    Inconsistency: Giving different responses to inquiries from different users.
    Downtime: Not responding to incoming requests for information at all.
